          As a graphic and web designer, I developed an appreciation of design principles and typography, and came away with a very serious eye towards my own work. For each assignment (like magazine articles or logos), we were given a few days to work on each piece. But &ldquo;turning in&rdquo; your work involved standing at the front of the class, presenting your piece, and watching idly while your classmates ruthlessly tore into your design. You would hear that your piece was ineffective at its goals, or that you didn't use space efficiently, or that it &ldquo;just sucked&rdquo;. It was an incredibly humbling experience, and gave me a fantastic appreciation of the amount of work it took to make something effective.
